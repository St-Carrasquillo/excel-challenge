# Crowd Funding Analysis 
### Given the provided data, what are three conclusions that we can draw about crowdfunding campaigns?
1.	The Arts like Theater, Film and Video are the most common type of crowd funding category.
2.	Mobile Games is the sub-category with highest fails vs grand total.
3.	Most are started in July and January.
### What are some limitations of this dataset?
*	Based on what we were given, the period that a crowd funding campaign was open for donations. However, we can figure that out with a calculation of the launch date and deadline. 
*	Reasons for cancellations. Some canceled campaigns were almost at their goal or over 50% to their goal.
*	When individual donations were received. 
### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create, and what additional value would they provide?
*	We could create a table to see the percentage of successful campaigns based on category or subcategory. If we were looking to start our own crowdfunding campaign, we would know the potential success rate based on that analysis.
*	If we knew when individual donations were received, we could create a table that shows the trend for donations based on the time that a campaign was open for donations. That could indicate for example if most donations were received within a certain period of the campaign being open.

## Crowd Funding Goal Analysis 
Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
*	The Mean is the better option to summarize the data. The mean (average) itself is a summary and more useful when your data has outliers and extreme variations in the values. For both datasets the average of just the Min and Max are closer to the Mean than the Median. 
Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?
*	There is more variability with successful campaigns because the standard deviation is higher. This makes sense because there is a lot more data to use in the calculations. There are 565 Successful campaigns vs 364 Failed campaigns.
